  <h2>Description</h2>
  A mexican classic just in time for the holidays. Pozole has indigenous origins
  from all the way during the times of the aztecs. The once ceremonial dish is 
  now a staple among mexican and mexican-americans alike. 

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1⁄2 lbs pork shoulder</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cumin powder</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons california chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1⁄4 teaspoon oregano</li>
    <li>4 cups canned white hominy, drained and rinsed</li>
    <li>3-5 cups pork broth, from cooking pork shoulder</li>
    <li>1 cup canned diced green chilis <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>2 whole fresh jalapenos, chopped <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>3 whole ancho chilies, seeded and stemmed <em>(garnish, optional)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the onion, peel the garlic, chop the onion, peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves, 
chop the green chilies and jalapenos if you are using them and get the hominy drained and rinsed</li>
<li>Boil the ancho chilies in a separate small pot for the garnish part<em>(read below)</em></li>
<strong>Now you are ready to cook.</strong>
<li>Place the meat in a large saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water</li>
<li>Add 1/2 chopped onion, the 2 cloves peeled garlic, pepper, cumin, and oregano</li>
<li>Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that rises, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes</li>
<li>Remove meat and broth, reserving both</li>
<li>Saute the remaining chopped onion and garlic in oil until translucent</li>
<li>Add the remaining spices, stir for a minute
<li>Cut the reserved pork into 1 inch cubes and add to the pan
<li>Stir in the canned hominy, pork broth <em>(if there is not enough pork broth, add chicken stock, I like to add it 
    anyway for flavor, about 2-4 cups, eyeball the amount you like)</em> 
    green chilies and jalapenos <em>(optional)</em></li>
<li>Cook at a simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes until the meat and hominy are tender.
<li>If necessary, cook for up to an additional 60 minutes until the chilies and onions are well blended into the broth.
<li>Degrease the stew, taste for salt, and serve in soup bowls.
<li>This is a delicious recipe and well worth the effort to make.
<li>Garnishes that are always served with are:</li>
<ul>
<li>lots of lime/lemon wedges</li>
<li>sliced radishes</li>
<li>chopped cilantro</li>
<li>Shredded cabbage<em>(not red)</em></li>
<li>fresh/ packaged fried corn tortillas</li>
</ul>
<li>When my ancho chilies are soft from boiling<em>(takes about 15 minutes)</em>, 
then put them in the blender with 1 1/2cups of water,
1 clove of garlic and about 2 tablespoons diced onion,
and about 1 tablespoons of salt and pepper</li> 
<li>I blend this thin, then strain it to get the liquid separated from its "pulp"</li>
<li>I throw the pulp into the soup for the flavor i like but you can discard if too spicy for you</li>
<li>The remaining liquid you put in a serving dish for guests to add in their own bowl, if desired</li>
<strong>Beware! It's HOT!</strong>
