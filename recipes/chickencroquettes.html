<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chicken Croquettes are filled with panko, chopped red and green bell peppers, cooked chicken,
     creamy mayonnaise, seasoned with garlic powder and mixed together into small rounds. 
     These are SO easy to make! These are perfect for a light dinner, easy appetizer or a quick snack!</p>   

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
        <li>¼ cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced celery</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>⅛ tablespoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs, for rolling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine 1/3 cup of the soup, chicken, bread crumbs, celery, onion and 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning. 
Mix well and shape into 6 croquettes (I make patties). Chill in refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li>


<li>Remove croquettes from refrigerator and roll in additional bread crumbs. In a large skillet,
melt 1 to 2 tablespoons shortening. Brown the croquettes in the shortening. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan,
combine the remaining soup, milk and 1/8 teaspoon poultry seasoning. Heat over low, stirring occasionally. 
Serve sauce over croquette</li>
